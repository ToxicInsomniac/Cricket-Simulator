# Cricket-Simulator
Python code that simulates a cricket match and prints ball by ball outcomes of the match and generates a scorecard in an excel file.


IMPORTANT!!! Download and store Scorecards.xlsx in the same folder/directory as the main program. It is essential for saving the match summary. Will cause fatal error if not done.


Run the code preferably with IDLE as opposed to a code editor. This was coded in the basic text file and code editors might give unpredicatable outputs in terms of formatting.
The program uses weighted probabilities based off of data and statistics, averaged over hundreds of cricket matches, to determine the ball by ball outcome of a match.
The program can and has been scaled up to larger scopres such as tournaments with 20+ teams. However, in the given time constraint I was unabe to make them accessible to a general audience. So I've cut a handful of features to keep it simple and display the program at it's core. I've also added one particular feature to give the code "character".
Evidence for features like "Statistics collection" and "Tournaments" have been uploaded as .xlsx files for your viewing pleasure.
NOTE: Feel free to make errors while entering inputs the program demands do discover it's "character". Or skim through the code yourself.
NOTE: ALso make sure to delete scorecards as the naming scheme might clash with newer scorecards.
NOTE: For sample outputs use simple names like "aaaaaa" or "111111" cause entering full names might be tedious. If you don't mind it then knock yourself out.
Thank you for your consideration.
